# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
A quick means of simulating the outcomes of playing a slot machine game over the course of a number of trials. The primary aim is to determine the average number of plays it takes to fulfill the conditions of the game, along with win/loss totals given a set amount of coins. 

Slot.py is the game simulation, while MonteCarlo.py is a simple 100 sided die roll that calculates the win/loss average over a number of trials and it is used as a basis for Slot.py
